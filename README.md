# Spotify Playlists Remote Watchapp

## DEPRECATED: I'm no loner updating this project as I don't use Spotify or a Pebble anymore.

A simple Pebble remote for switching Spotify playlists. **Requires Android-only companion app.**

### FAQ
**Why doesn't this support free Spotify users?**
There's no way for a third party app to launch a playlist for a free user.

**Why do I have to manually launch Spotify?**
I'm currently looking into a way around this.

### Android Companion App
